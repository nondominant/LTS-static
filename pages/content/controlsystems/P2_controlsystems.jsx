  <p>In order to get an overview of your own company from a business as well as a technical point of view, networking of all machines is a basic requirement. Without networking, no operations control system is able to map production-relevant data, not to mention to control processes. For most laundries, building a completely new one-stop laundry remains utopia. The reality is, a large number of different production machines are operated by different manufacturers that could not be networked with eachother</p>
